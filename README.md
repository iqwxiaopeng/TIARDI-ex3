PC + windows
 
Assignment
----------
<ol>
<li>Develop a PC client application based on the Reactor pattern. The client application shall send the different event types described in exercise 2 using the Wrapper Facades developed in exercise 1. The client and the server shall use TCP as the communication channel.</li>
<li>Implement the real version of the <em>Synchronous Event Demultiplexer</em> class in the PC server application using the Wrapper Facades from exercise 1.</li>
<li>Test the server application with a client application on the same PC connected by a TCP connection (localhost).</li>
<li>Test the server application with the client application on another PC connected by a TCP connection.</li>
</ol>
 
Product / delivery / deadline
-----------------------------
This is the first mandatory hand-in, where Your solution to exercise 3 will encompass your solutions to exercise 1 and 2.
The hand-in must be structured as a word design document, with a short description of your client and server including UML class diagrams and UML sequence diagrams. The second part of the hand in is a Visual Studio project with the source code.
Your complete solution to Exercise 3 is to be finalized and handed-in as a Zip file via Campusnet â€“ see the course schedule for deadline.
 
Evaluation
----------
UML designs from one or more groups are presented and discussed on the class.
You will get feedback on your hand-ins 1 week after the deadline.
